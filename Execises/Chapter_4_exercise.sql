-- Chapter 4: Importing and Exporting Data
--1. Write a WITH statement to include with COPY to handle the import of an
-- imaginary text file whose first couple of rows look like this:
-- id:movie:actor
-- 50:#Mission: Impossible#:Tom Cruise

-- called movies.txt and create the actors table below. 
-- CREATE TABLE actors (
--     id integer,
--     movie text,
--     actor text
-- );

COPY actors
FROM 'C:\YourDirectory\movies.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER ':', QUOTE '#');

--2. Using the table us_counties_2010 you created and filled in this chapter,
-- export to a CSV file the 20 counties in the United States that have the most
-- housing units Make sure you export only each countyâ€™s name, state, and
-- number of housing units (Hint: Housing units are totaled for each county
-- in the column housing_unit_count_100_percent
COPY (
    SELECT geo_name, state_us_abbreviation, housing_unit_count_100_percent
    FROM us_counties_2010 ORDER BY housing_unit_count_100_percent DESC LIMIT 20
     )
TO 'C:\YourDirectory\us_counties_housing_export.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);

-- 3. Imagine you're importing a file that contains a column with these values:
      -- 17519.668
      -- 20084.461
      -- 18976.335
-- Will a column in your target table with data type numeric(3,8) work for these
-- values? Why or why not?

-- Answer:
-- No, it won't. In fact, you won't even be able to create a column with that
-- data type because the precision must be larger than the scale. The correct
-- type for the example data is numeric(8,3).
